What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint?

and individual backend for features.

What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint?

Using customized material UI to make the UI and overall presentation of the front end better. 
Make sure to take into importance the UI of the app rather than just functionality of the backend. 
Have all the documentations in one place. 

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint?

Stop using basic material UI. 

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2? 

Best Experience:
Being able to add more and more features to the app.
