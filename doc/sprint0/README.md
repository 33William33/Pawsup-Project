# Pawsup

## Motivation

Pawsup is an Android application for helping pet owners find suitable services for their pets. These services may include: pet boarding, pet walking, pet daycare, etc.
Current pet boarding services might not provide any one-on-one assistance for the owners. On the other hand, owners may also be somewhat hesitant to seek private services due to the lack of prior contract or agreement.
The purpose of Pawsup is to provide a method for pet owners and service providers to discuss and agree to things ahead of time. The application is open to both needing pet services and those providing them.
